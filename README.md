## Hey there! 👋

I'm Nathan — a Systems Administrator with 10+ years of experience managing complex hybrid environments (Windows Server + RHEL), most recently at global scale with Verizon Connect.

Right now, I’m upskilling through the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) Back-End Developer Path and getting hands-on with Python to build a strong foundation in back-end concepts like APIs, data structures, and web architecture. I’m building a portfolio that shows what I can *actually* do — not just what I’ve read or watched. Soon, I’ll be moving into Go for more production-level back-end engineering.

I'm big on clean, documented troubleshooting, automation, and making systems that *just work* — so people can focus on their jobs without tech getting in the way.

Feel free to poke around my repos — I’ll be adding more as I go! 🚀
